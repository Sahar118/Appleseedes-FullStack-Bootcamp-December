/* 1. explain in your own words what is the problem. */
/* becouse the absolute it pertains to its parent element, so if we 
want to put div in other div, we have to make the inner divs absolute and the outer 
or the parent relative.
in this exampke we make the inner absolute but the outer we didn't make the outer position relative */

/* 2. fix the code using the positions weâ€™ve learned. */
